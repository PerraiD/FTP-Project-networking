# FTP-Project-networking
A small ftp project written in C for the networking course in MASTER ALMA

## Compilation

go to the folder and do `make`

**It makes sense but we need to launch server before launch client**

## Launch server

```
./server
```

## Launch a client

```
./client server-adress
```
Replace server-adress by its ip (i.e 140.20.10.5);
